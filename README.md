# INTELLIGENT-DATA
Intelligent Data is a dynamic information structure that combines logic, memory, and behavior into a single executable form. It is not a program, a dataset, or a model â€” it is data that processes itself, responds to its environment, and continuously refines its output without external reprogramming.
