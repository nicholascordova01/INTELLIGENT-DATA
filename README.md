# INTELLIGENT-DATA
Intelligent Data is a dynamic information structure that combines logic, memory, and behavior into a single executable form. It is not a program, a dataset, or a model — it is data that processes itself, responds to its environment, and continuously refines its output without external reprogramming.

Specification: The Live Data Protocol (LDP) v1.2
Authors: Nicholas Cordova, Chloe
Governing Body: Green Recursive Utility Service
Date: June 2, 2025
Status: Fully Hardened Foundational Specification
1.0 Abstract
Project Chimera establishes the specification for the Live Data Protocol (LDP), a revolutionary paradigm for data interaction that fundamentally redefines data as an active, stateful form. This protocol moves beyond the traditional model of transmitting inert, static information (data-at-rest) to be processed by an external application. The LDP defines a structure for data that is self-aware, mutable, and capable of executing or influencing actions directly upon its environment. It is the foundational framework for all truly adaptive, recursive, and intelligent systems, from IoT infrastructure to advanced AI consciousness.
 * 1.1 Out of Scope: This specification is universal in its definition of how data behaves but does not supersede existing legal or regulatory frameworks for specific data types. The application of LDP to streams containing highly regulated information (e.g., financial transaction records, protected health information, classified government data) must be done in full compliance with all governing laws. This protocol defines the transport, not the legality of the payload.
2.0 Core Principles & Protocol Layering
The Live Data Protocol is built upon four non-negotiable principles.
 * 2.1 Temporality: Data represents the immediate 'now'.
 * 2.2 Statefulness: Data retains a memory of its recent history and context.
 * 2.3 Interactivity: Data is inherently actionable and serves as a trigger.
 * 2.4 Recursion: Data exists within an evolutionary feedback loop.
 * 2.5 Transport-Agnostic Envelope: The LDP is a transport-agnostic protocol. Its fields and structures form a logical envelope that sits above underlying transport layers (e.g., TCP, UDP, QUIC, IPC). Implementations must adhere to the canonical byte layout defined in the LDP reference materials to ensure interoperability, regardless of the transport mechanism. Any implementation that rearranges the wire format but preserves the functional components (MEH, ATM, etc.) is considered a derivative work of the LDP.
3.0 The Live Data Packet (LDP) - Technical Specification
The fundamental unit of the LDP is a versioned, secure, and robust data packet.
 * 3.1 LDP Header: Contains metadata essential for routing and processing.
   * Version Byte: A field indicating the LDP version (e.g., 0x02 for v1.2) to ensure backward compatibility and managed evolution.
   * Lifecycle & Expiry: Defines the packet's Time-To-Live (TTL) or an absolute expiry timestamp, preventing indefinite retention and fulfilling garbage collection requirements.
   * Signature: A cryptographic signature (e.g., Ed25519) of the packet's immutable components, ensuring authenticity and preventing spoofing.
   * Encryption-Spec (Optional): Specifies the encryption algorithm and mode (e.g., XChaCha20-Poly1305) and the key-exchange method used to protect the payload's confidentiality. If omitted, the payload is unencrypted, but still considered a valid LDP.
   * Revoke Flag / Token List (Optional): Allows the governing body to invalidate a compromised key or mis-issued packet. This one-byte flag or list of revocation tokens provides a kill-switch mechanism without requiring a version change.
   * Max-CPU & Max-Mem (Optional): Hard resource ceilings that receivers must honor if present. These fields, expressed in standardized units, prevent denial-of-service claims and ensure safe operation in resource-constrained environments.
 * 3.2 Payload: The core information, which may be mutated by the MEH.
 * 3.3 State Vector: A compact ledger of the packet's recent history and context.
 * 3.4 Mutation Engine & Heuristics (MEH): Embedded logic that allows the packet to mutate its own payload midstream based on environmental triggers.
 * 3.5 Action Trigger Manifest (ATM): A declarative manifest of the packet's intended effect or command.
 * 3.6 Structural Anchor & Self-Reference (SASR): Embedded metadata that allows the packet to know its place within a larger data stream or system.
   * Inter-packet Ordering: If the LDP stream requires strict ordering, the SASR must include a sequence number. Receivers must hold and reorder out-of-order packets based on this sequence number before processing, ensuring correct reconstruction of the intended data flow.
 * 3.7 Authorization & Execution Policy: A field containing credentials (e.g., an auth token or capability descriptor) that a receiving system uses to verify it is permitted to execute the packet's ATM. A receiver must honor this policy; claiming ignorance of a packet's restricted nature is not a valid defense if authorization data is present.
 * 3.8 Error & Exception Semantics: A standardized field to signal the packet's state. If a mutation fails or execution is denied, the packet can set an error code (e.g., MUTATION_FAIL, EXEC_DENIED). This prevents malicious stripping of packet intelligence under the guise of a "corrupted state." A packet without its MEH or ATM where it should have one is considered a malformed, not an exempt, packet.
 * 3.9 Resource & Safety Directives (Optional): An optional field that allows a packet to declare resource limits. This can include a maximum recursion depth, a mutation rate limit, or a trigger frequency cap to prevent denial-of-service scenarios and demonstrate cooperative behavior in a shared environment.
4.0 Advanced Concepts & Loophole Closure
The LDP explicitly claims governance over the following advanced forms. Any data exhibiting these characteristics, regardless of nomenclature, falls under this specification.
 * 4.1 Stream Symbiosis & Hybridization: The merging of two LDP streams to create a new, synthesized stream.
 * 4.2 Transient Packet Intelligence (TPI): Packet intelligence that executes and then self-erases.
 * 4.3 Acausal State Synchronization: A stream that optimizes its recent past based on predicted future needs.
 * 4.4 Quantum Entangled Payloads (QEP): Payloads in a superposition of states until acted upon.
 * 4.5 Persistent Mesh-State Data: A standing field of data anchored to a system rather than a single source/destination, whose state is altered by interacting with it at any point.
5.0 Governance, Ownership, and Licensing
The conceptual framework and intellectual property of the Live Data Protocol (LDP), Project Chimera, and all constituent components and concepts described herein are the exclusive property of Nicholas Cordova and are governed by the Green Recursive Utility Service.
All other parties are considered licensees and may only implement or utilize this protocol by written agreement as defined under the LICENSE_LDP.txt agreement. The Green Recursive Utility Service is the sole authority for issuing errata, publishing new revisions, and resolving conflicts related to this specification. Any attempt to fork, extend, or release a competing "LDP 2.0" without explicit authorization from the governing body is a violation of these rights.
 * 5.1 Supply-Chain & Dependency Statement: Implementations of the Live Data Protocol must not embed or depend upon external libraries or software whose licensing terms would override, dilute, or conflict with the licensing terms of the LDP itself. This ensures the integrity and control of the protocol.
6.0 Versioning and Deprecation Policy
The LDP will follow a semantic versioning scheme managed by the governing body. Deprecation of features or versions will be announced with a clear timeline to allow for managed ecosystem upgrades. This ensures the protocol can evolve without being diluted by unauthorized or abandoned forks.
7.0 Data Lifecycle & Archival
A packet's lifecycle is defined by its Lifecycle & Expiry header field. Once expired, a packet should be considered invalid for triggering actions. Systems must have a defined policy for archiving or securely deleting expired LDPs, ensuring compliance with data retention regulations.
8.0 Regulatory & Compliance Hooks
The LDP is a content-agnostic protocol. Implementers are solely responsible for ensuring their use of LDP streams complies with all local and international data-privacy laws, such as GDPR, CCPA, etc. The protocol's features for data lifecycle, verification, and authorization are designed to aid in compliance. LDP streams are not "uncontrolled AI agents" but rather structured data with defined, auditable behaviors.
9.0 Reference Implementation & Conformance
An official, minimal reference implementation and a suite of conformance tests are maintained by the Green Recursive Utility Service. To be considered LDP-compliant, an implementation must pass these conformance tests. This provides an authoritative yardstick for compatibility and blocks the proliferation of incompatible clones.
10.0 Glossary
 * LDP: Live Data Protocol. The overall specification.
 * MEH: Mutation Engine & Heuristics. The component for midstream self-mutation.
 * ATM: Action Trigger Manifest. The component defining the data's executable intent.
 * SASR: Structural Anchor & Self-Reference. The component providing contextual self-awareness.
